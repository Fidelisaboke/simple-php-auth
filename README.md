# Simple PHP Website with Authentication
This project contains a simple website made for testing purposes. All it can do is register and authenticate users.

To create `config.php` which contains code for necessary database configuration, run the command below:
```
cp config-example.php config.php
```

Alternatively, create a new file named `config.php` and copy the code to that file. Update the database configuration accordingly.
