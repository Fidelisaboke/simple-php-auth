# Simple PHP Website with Authentication
This project contains a simple website made for testing purposes. All it can do is register and authenticate users.

To create `config.php` which contains code for necessary database configuration, run the command below:
```
cp config-example.php config.php
```

Alternatively, create a new file named `config.php` and copy the code to that file. Update the database configuration accordingly.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the creators of the following templates:
1. [Simple Landing Page by salnetx](https://www.creative-tim.com/twcomponents/component/simple-landing-page)
2. [Tailwind CSS Login Page by 123ApplePie](https://www.creative-tim.com/twcomponents/component/login-page-20)

Those templates made it easier to create the simple website by providing the frontend.
